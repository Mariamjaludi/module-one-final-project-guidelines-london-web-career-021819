# The Pocket PT App

Pocket PT is a command line database application that will generate workouts for a user depending on their fitness goals. Pocket PT also allows a user to create their own workouts by supplying them with a list of exercises depending on the type of workout they would like to do as well as their fitness goal. The app comes with a wide variety of exercises to choose from which can be tailored to meet the user's workout goals. Users can select from weight loss training, a muscle gain program, and an endurance series for those wanting to focus on cardio. The APP will store user workout data so that each time you come back to train your vital statistics will be readily accessible.
